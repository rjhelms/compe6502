notes on basic implementation:

- create a ZEROPAGE_BASIC segment (ZP, after ZEROPAGE), change zeropage.s to use this instead of 
- rename existing VECTORS to BOOTVECTORS and add a VECTORS segment in BASROM
- CODE segment used in both BASIC and ROM - probably easier to rename mine!
	- create SYS segment higher up

- need a DUMMY segment - see MSBASIC config for example
