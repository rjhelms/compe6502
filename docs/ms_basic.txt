notes on basic implementation:

- create a ZEROPAGE_BASIC segment (ZP, after ZEROPAGE), change zeropage.s to use
    this instead of ZEROPAGE
- rename existing VECTORS to BOOTVECTORS and add a VECTORS segment lower down
- CODE segment used in both BASIC and ROM - probably easier to rename mine!
	- create BIOS segment higher up

- all BASIC segments go below BIOS
    - align BIOS segment just fer grins

- need a DUMMY segment - see MSBASIC config for example
